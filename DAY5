You are given a list of N integers List[], list contains both +ve and -ve integers.
Your task is to findout, the Highest Product possible,
Where the product is the product of all the elements of contiguous sublist sList[],
and sub list should conatin atleast 1 integer.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N.
Line-2: N space separated integers, List[].

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer output, the highest product.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
4
2 3 -2 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
6

Explanation:
------------
Product of contiguous sub list [2,3].


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3
-2 0 -3

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0

Explanation:
------------
Product of sub list [0], where [-2,-3] is not a contiguous sublist


SOL:
def pro(arr):
    minVal = arr[0]
    maxVal = arr[0]
    maxProduct = arr[0]
    n=len(l)
    for i in range(1, n, 1):
        if (arr[i] < 0):
            temp = maxVal
            maxVal = minVal
            minVal = temp
        maxVal = max(arr[i], maxVal * arr[i])
        minVal = min(arr[i], minVal * arr[i])
        maxProduct = max(maxProduct, maxVal)
    return maxProduct
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(pro(l))
    
  
Arjun is playing a word game in his tab.When he start the game , It displays a word and he has to check for any two adjacent characters which are same.If found he has to select those two characters by tapping, so that both characters will be deleted from the word and the word size shrinks by 2. This process to be repeated until the word has no two adjacent characters are same.
You task is to help Arjun to perform the above task and Return the final word obtained.



Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: A string represents the word.

Output Format:
--------------
Return a string or empty string.


If empty string print -1

Constraints:
------------   
    1 <= word.length <= 10^5   
    word consists only lower case letters.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
pqqprs

Sample Output-1:
----------------
rs

Explanation:
-------------
Initially , Delete two 'q's then the word will be 'pprs'. Now Delete two 'p's then the word will be rs.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
pqqqprrs

Sample Output-2:
----------------
pqps

Explanation:
-------------
Initially , Delete two 'q's then the word will be 'pqprrs'. Now Delete two 'r's then the word will be pqps.

PROGRAM 3:
Christina has given a task to break his friends code 
he will given all lower case alphabets  and code as the input 
Christina has to figure the text from the code and display the text 

Input - The first line of input consists of lower case alphabets and code 
The first alphabet letter will given 01, second alphabet will be given 02, and so on 
Output - Break the code and display the string 


Sample Test Case - 1 
input =
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
110525

Explantion - 
From the above test case we have 'a' has '01', 'b' has '02', and finally 'z' has '26' 
where each alphabet will be assigned a two digit number 
and for the code 110525 the characters will be 11 as 'k', 05 as 'e' and 25 as 'y' 
so the output is "key" 

Sample Test Case - 2
input =
qpwoeirutyalskdjfhgzmxncbv
131013090521
output = system


Explantion - From the above test case we have 'q' as '01' , 'p' as '02' and finally 'v' as '26'
and for the code 131013090521 we have the following code 
13-s
10-y
13-s
09-t
05-e
21-m

so the output is system

code:

s=input()
num=input()
k=""
for i in range(0,len(num),2):
    k=k+s[int(num[i:i+2])-1]
print(k)


code:

s=input()
num=input()
k=""
for i in range(0,len(num),2):
    k=k+s[int(num[i:i+2])-1]
print(k)
