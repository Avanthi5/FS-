PROGRAM 1:

Harsha a second class student is playing a game on his tab. 

where he has go to second level. He can reach second level if and only if he solves the first level. 

In the first level he will be a given a number series which will contain only '1' and '0's. 

He has to replace '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' and add '1' at the end and produce a new result. 

If he is able to produce a new result he can reach the second level. Help him to reach the second level. 


Examples:

 "0111" is "1000" and adding 1 at the end we get 1001
 "1100" is  "0011" and adding 1 at the end we get 0100

Here adding will done from the last 
when we add two '1's  we get 10 as the result and 1 is carry forwarded, on continuing the same process we get 0100 as the result 


Sample Test Case - 1
input = 0111
output = 1001

Sample Test Case - 2
input = 1100
output = 0100


CODE:

def binary(s):
    k=""
    for i in s:
        if i=='1':
            k=k+'0'
        else:
            k=k+'1'
    l=int(k,2)
    c=l+1
    c=bin(c)
    c=c[2::]
    if len(c)>=len(s):
        return c
    else:
        
        return ('0'*(len(s)-len(c))+c)
    
    
        
s=input()
print(binary(s))


PROGRAM 2:
D-Mart Online Shopping portal is giving a buy-2 get-1 free discount.
There are various categories of goods and the offer is valid on a group of items if they belong to the same category.
All items in the same category are priced equal.
So, If you buy 3 items of category A, you pay only for 2 items. 
But if you buy 2 items of category A and 1 of category B, you pay for all 3 items. 
Given the categories for various items in your shopping cart and the price for each category, 
calculate the total price that you will have to pay.

Input
Each test case will contain two lines. 
First line will be a string comprising of only alphabets (only upper case)
Each character represents a category in the shop. 
Next line will contain a space separated list of 26 integers where 1st integer is price for category A, 
2nd integer is price for category B and 26th integer is price for category Z.
Output
For each test case, print on a single line the price that the customer will have to pay.

1 2 3 3 2 1 4 7 9 10 11 13 12 1 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 11 14 15
output
34

Explanation :-
A B C D E F G H I J  K  L  M  N O P Q R S T U V  W X  Y  Z
1 2 3 3 2 1 4 7 9 10 11 13 12 1 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 11 14 15

in the above input we have the frequency count of category as follows

      I * P  =  Amount
A-4 - 3 * 1  =   3
B-3 - 2 * 2  =   4
C-1 - 1 * 3  =   3
D-2 - 2 * 3  =   6
E-1 - 1 * 2  =   2
F-1 - 1 * 1  =   1
Z-1 - 1 * 15 =  15
       Total  =  34

if we buy two items we get one item free, so in 4 items of Category-A we have to bill only for 3 items 
for Category B we have to bill only for 2 items. 

In the above frequency I represents the Number of Items for each Category and P represent the cost  
if we sum all of them we get the total price to be paid by the customer.

in the above input we have the frequency count of category as follows
      C *  P    AMOUNT
Z-4 - 3 * 12  =  36

PROGRAM 3:

Stanely a old grand father reads a news paper daily.
While reading a newspaper his grandsone sits besides him. 
His grandson is intresed in the puzzle given in the newspaper. 
In the puzzle there will be few rows and columns which contains only alphabets and a new word will be given at the end. 
we have to see if the word is present in the above given rows or columns and print the correspoind row and column index .
Help Stanely and his grandsone to solve this. 


assume the length of the word is <= rowsize/columnsize
and the word may be present either vertically or horizontally

if the word is not present print -1

Reading a Character Array from the user 
char a[][]=new char[m][n];
for(i=0;i<m;i++)
for(j=0;j<n;j++)
  a[i][j]=sc.next().charAt(0);

Here a[][] is 2 dimensional character array
