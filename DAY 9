PROGRAM 1:

Tubby a Third Class Student has given a Assignment on Time Chapter by his class teacher.
Tubby is supposed to change the time given in AM/PM Format to 24 Hours Format. 
Help Tubby Solve the Problem 

The Maths teacher gave him the time in the following Format - HH:MM:SS:AM/PM

Assume all HH,MM,SS are in the valid range only 
 
Note: Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock,  and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. 
Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock,  and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. 
     
Assume all input times are valid

Back end test cases

input = 06:10:20PM
output = 18:10:20

input = 01:45:50PM
output = 13:45:50

input = 10:05:30AM
output = 10:05:30

input = 02:13:19AM
output = 02:13:19
    
    
 CODE:
 def time(s):
    t=s[-2::]
    k1=int(s[0:2])
    if t=='AM':
        if k1==12:
            return ('00'+s[2:len(s)-2])
        return s[0:len(s)-2]
    l=int(s[0:2])+12
    if l<24:
        k=str(int(s[0:2])+12)+s[2:len(s)-2]
    else:    
        k=str((int(s[0:2])+12)%12)+s[2:len(s)-2]
    return k

n=input()
print(time(n))



PROGRAM 2:
Shyam is given a sentence and asked him to check if it is the same reading from both sides or not. If it is same print true else print false


Note - Assume the input line here is not case sensitive
ignore the special symbols,spaces and compare only the characters and print true or false


input =a man a plan a canal panama
output = 1

in the above  example first character is 'a' last character is 'a'
second character is 'm' last second character is 'm' and comparing so on all characters should be equal


input =do nine men interpret nine men i nod
output = true

input =Red rum, sir, is murder
output = true 

input = Was it a cat I saw?
output = true

input =Eva,   can I s e e b^% e e s i n a ca;;;ve?
output = true 

input =No lemon, no melon
output = true 

CODE:
def palindrome(s1):
    s=s1.lower()
    k=""
    for i in s:
        if ord('a')<=ord(i)<=ord('z'):
            k=k+i
    if k==k[::-1]:
        return True
    return False
n=input()
print(palindrome(n))
